# PyTorch-AI-project
## A Capstone Project for a Coursera AI Engineering course.
This repository is an AI engineering project done by PyTorch package. This is my solution for Coursera AI Engineering capstone project. Here, you will find how I prepare data for analysis and solve a problem about distinguishing different photos by learning image features.

This project is written in Python3. And, the useful libraries are listed here for your reference:
1. **Pytorch**
2. **NumPy**
3. **Scikit-learn**
