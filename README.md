# PyTorch-AI-project
## A Capstone Project for a Coursera AI Engineering course.
This repository is an AI engineering project done by PyTorch package. This is my solution for Coursera AI Engineering capstone project. Here, you will find how I prepare data for analysis and solve a problem about distinguishing different photos by learning image features.

This project is written in Python3. And, the useful libraries are listed here for your reference:
1. **PyTorch**
2. **NumPy**
3. **Scikit-learn**
4. **Matplotlib**
********************
Here are __four__ Jupyter Notebook scripts. They actually include **4 main steps** in the project, respectively:
1. Load_and_prepare_data.ipynb (Downloading raw data and examining data)
2. Data_loader_PyTorch.ipynb   (Data pre-processing)
3. Linear_classifier_Pytorch.ipynb (Linear classifier with PyTorch, )
4. Final lab_PyTorch_submitable.ipynb (Prepare my own model with a pretrained model : *resnet18*)
